What is Cyclope
===============

:synopsys: ``Cyclope`` is a `Django`_ based CMS. It is built around the idea of collections of categorized content objects which can be displayed using different associated views.
:copyright: 2010 by `CÃ³digo Sur <http://www.codigosur.org>`_
:url: http://bitbucket.org/nicoechaniz/django-cyclope/
:version: 0.1.0
:licence: GPL v3

``Cyclope`` provides a Category model which is attached to any model that derives from the provided BaseContent class.

Content models can register their views to make them available for display in the different site layouts.

Target audience
---------------

``Cyclope`` is developed with three different audiences in mind:

1. Developers:

    We developed ``Cyclope`` thinking of those developers that actually like to code in their language of choice: Python. They don't really look for a product that will let them accomplish even the most complex stuff from a web-based UI.

    We just aim at providing developers with the tools necessary to easily expose their content types and views for site managers to work with in the admin interface.

    Custom created content types and views can easily be packed in modules for drop-in reutilization in other projects.

2. Site managers:

    They will use the Django admin interface to set up the website global settings, theme, layouts, menus, and categories.

3. Content editors:

    Will use the Django admin interface to create categories and content for the different content types and collections available in the website.
