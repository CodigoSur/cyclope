Target audience
---------------

``CyclopeCMS`` is developed with three different audiences in mind:

1. Developers:

    We created ``CyclopeCMS`` thinking of those developers that actually like to code in their language of choice: Python. They don't really look for a product that will let them accomplish even the most complex stuff from a web-based UI.

    We aim at providing developers with the tools necessary to build sites quickly, exposing their content types and views for site managers to work with in the admin interface.

    Custom created content types and views can easily be packed in modules for drop-in re-utilization.

2. Site managers:

    Use the Django admin interface to set up the website global settings, theme, layouts, menus, and categories.

3. Content editors:

    Can create content and categories via a customized Django admin interface, integrating the different content types and collections available in the website.


Installation
------------

To install in a virtualenv just ``pip install cyclope3``.
