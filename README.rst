========

:synopsys: CyclopeCMS is a Content Management System or Content Management System developed by CódigoSur with organizations and social movements in Latin America since 2002.

CyclopeCMS is a django based CMS for pythonistas who don't mind coding a bit and dislike overly-complex user interfaces. It is based on the concept of categorized collections of heterogeneous content types with associated front-end views that can be laid out in the website's page regions. The goal of this project is to create a CMS that is friendly to the end user and versatile for the developer. It won't solve every complex problem at UI level but will let you "expose" the solution.

CyclopeCMS collaborates with the empowerment of organizations and social movements in building knowledge and own free technology while promoting freedom of expression. CyclopeCMS not pursue commercial purposes, so the software besides being free, is free. Being free software, economic CyclopeCMS development model is based on solidarity between the different organizations involved in the project and those new ones that want to join.

CyclopeCMS is developed based on the support and participation of social organizations and movements in the project. Consider making a donation to the project or hire a service CódigoSur.

Target audience
---------------

``CyclopeCMS`` is developed with three different audiences in mind:

1. Developers:

    We created ``CyclopeCMS`` thinking of those developers that actually like to code in their language of choice: Python. They don't really look for a product that will let them accomplish even the most complex stuff from a web-based UI.

    We just aim at providing developers with the tools necessary to easily expose their content types and views for site managers to work with in the admin interface.

    Custom created content types and views can easily be packed in modules for drop-in re-utilization.

2. Site managers:

    They will use the Django admin interface to set up the website global settings, theme, layouts, menus, and categories.

3. Content editors:

    Will have access to a customized Django admin interface to create categories and content for the different content types and collections available in the website.
